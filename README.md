# Akari-AI

This project was the second assignment of my first year university unit "Software Engineering with Java" which i completed in collaboration with my cousin. On top of being tasked to create a playable version of the game "Akari", we were also told that extra marks would be given to projects that added something special, so for our project I single handedly made a simple algorithm that would solve the puzzles which earned us full points.
